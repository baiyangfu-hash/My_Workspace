# GitHub Project Management
Coordinates GitHub issue management, project board automation, and sprint planning using AI swarm agents. Supports issue triage / decomposition, bidirectional board sync, automated progress tracking, and KPI reporting.

## When to Use
- "Triage these unlabelled issues"
- "Break down this epic into subtasks"
- "Sync GitHub issues with the project board"
- "Set up a sprint with velocity tracking"
- "Generate a sprint-summary report"
- "Coordinate work across multiple repos / boards"
## Prerequisites
See [`references/troubleshooting.md`](references/troubleshooting.md#tool-prerequisites) for full tool versions, required token scopes, and GitHub API limits.
Minimum to run the plain `gh` examples: `gh` + `jq`. Swarm features additionally need `ruv-swarm` or `claude-flow` MCP server running — see those projects' docs for install. The skill degrades gracefully: anything prefixed with `npx ruv-swarm` requires the MCP server; everything else is plain `gh` + `jq`.
## Quick Start
```bash
# Create a coordinated issue
gh issue create \
  --title "Feature: Advanced Authentication" \
  --body "Implement OAuth2 with social login..." \
  --label "enhancement,swarm-ready"
# Initialise swarm tracking
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Feature implementation"
# Set up the board
PROJECT_ID=$(gh project list --owner @me --format json | jq -r '.projects[0].id')
npx ruv-swarm github board-init \
  --project-id "$PROJECT_ID" \
  --sync-mode "bidirectional"
```
## Workflow
1. **Triage** incoming issues — auto-label, link duplicates ([`issue-management.md`](references/issue-management.md))
2. **Decompose** large issues into subtasks with priority ([`issue-management.md`](references/issue-management.md))
3. **Sync** issues to the project board ([`board-automation.md`](references/board-automation.md))
4. **Pick the right swarm topology** (mesh / hierarchical / ring / star — see [`swarm-topologies.md`](references/swarm-topologies.md))
5. **Track sprint velocity & KPIs** ([`sprint-and-analytics.md`](references/sprint-and-analytics.md))
6. **Automate** via GitHub Actions + comment commands ([`automation-patterns.md`](references/automation-patterns.md))
7. **Verify** (see below)
## Verification
After running a workflow, confirm:
- [ ] Every issue acted on shows the expected label change in `gh issue view <num> --json labels`
- [ ] Every board-synced issue appears as a project card in the expected column
- [ ] Subtask checklists in issue bodies are valid Markdown (parseable; no broken `- [ ]` syntax)
- [ ] Progress comments posted by automation are idempotent — re-running doesn't duplicate
- [ ] `gh api rate_limit` shows headroom (running this against thousands of issues can exhaust the 5,000 req/hr limit; see [`troubleshooting.md`](references/troubleshooting.md#github-constraints-to-watch))
- [ ] Closed-as-stale issues match the explicit `STALE_DATE` cutoff — spot-check three
